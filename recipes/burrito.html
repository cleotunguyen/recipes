<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These Grilled Chicken Burritos are one of our favorite quick and easy meals. The chicken takes just mere minutes on the grill. And the burrito fillings are totally adaptable so you can use whatever you have on hand. We like to grill the outside of the burrito for an extra layer of crispiness.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>For the Grilled Chicken</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Chicken</strong> - I'm using boneless, skinless chicken breast tenders but you could absolutely use chicken thighs or another dark meat. You could also try this recipe with pork, steak, or shrimp - adjusting the cook time as needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Kosher Salt</strong> - The best kind for cooking but you could use Himalayan or table salt if that is all you have.</li>
  <li><strong>Garlic Powder</strong> - This is better than fresh garlic when grilling because if it's fresh, it'll burn and get bitter.</li>

</ul>

<h3>For the Burrito</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Burrito Shells</strong> - Definitely feel free to use whatever wrapper you have! These would be bomb with taco shells, too!</li>
  <li><strong>Pepper Jack Cheese</strong> - I love the added spice and creaminess of pepper jack but you could def use any other type of melting cheese or fresh Mexican cheese. Think of queso freso, cotjia, and more!</li>
  <li><strong>Refried Beans</strong> - I'm using a can of Amy's Refried Black Beans for convenience.... and because they're delicious! But you could use any sort of legume your heart desires.</li>
  <li><strong>Avocado</strong> - Avocado is optional but we love it in these grilled chicken burritos!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat your grill to medium-high.</li>
  <li>Grab a small bowl and add your room temp chicken tenders.</li>
  <li>Add salt, garlic powder, cumin, smoked paprika and some neutral oil.</li>
  <li>Once the grill is hot, add chicken tenders and close the grill for 2-3 minutes.</li>
</ol>
